            Hello my name is Natalia.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have a degree in engineering, but my passion has always been baking. Ever since I was young, I loved to bake and cook with my family. In my younger days I maintained a blog where I enjoyed sharing recipes with others. You might ask how an engineer became a baker? Owning and running a bakery has been a life-long dream for me, but I was pursuaded by my mother to pursue a career in a more lucrative field. Don't worry, I still get to use my engineering degree when creating crazy custom orders for my customer ;)
            <br>
            <br>
            It is a true honor to share my love and creations with others. I hope that Nataliaâ€™s become a second home to you. Thank you for your unyielding support.
