        <h1>How to Select a Good pet</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>1. Allergies – Do you or your loved ones have allergies to dander or saliva that comes with dogs or cats? </ul>
            <ul>2. Your space – Some pets need more space than others. If you rent, do your landlords or property managers allow pets? </ul> 
            <ul>3. Your life – Being a pet owner takes a lot of work. Are you prepared to make sure your dog gets enough exercise, regular veterinary care, training, and socialization?</ul>
            <ul>4. Age – Puppies and kittens are a lot of work. They will require potty, socialization, spaying and neutering, and may even destroy things.</ul>
            <ul>5. Personality and temperament – Meet before you get your companion! It’s hard to know from an online photo if a pet will have a personality and energy level that is a good match for you. </ul>
            <ul>6. Life span – Dogs live an average of 12 years. This is an average, so your pet may not live so long or live longer. Are you emotionally prepared to outlive your pet?</ul>
            <ul>7. Financial situation – It can cost an upwards of $3,000 a year for a dog after paying one-time costs. Some pets have more needs than other pets, which can increase costs. We need to take good care of our pets. It’s important to schedule regular check-ups to keep pets vaccinated and protected against parasites and disease. </ul>
