    <h2>Pros</h2>
        The designer kept the page layout clean, spacious, and appropriate for the target audience. The navigation was consistently labled and easy to find. The color scheme used was appropriate for the location of the buissness.
    <br>
    <h2>Cons</h2>
        The designer did not spellcheck their webpage and there are many errors through the website. There is essentially no accessibility markers. No map or directions to the buissness. No alternate text for disabled audience. No internal nor external hyperlinks were provided. No navigational bread crumbs at the top of the page.
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    Overall the webpage was simple and easy to follow, but it seems a bit outdated. I would provide another page that includes local buissness, restaurants, and areas for sightseeing. The activities page needs more information about the anemeties the resort provides. Another good idea would be to include a gallery with pictures of the resort.
